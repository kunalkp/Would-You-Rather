# Would You Rather Project

A web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

## Use

The game goes like this:
A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## Installation

To run the project, use these two commands via terminal:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Data

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions

### Users

| answers   | Object | The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options. |
